This repository contains a MATLAB function that throws an uninformative error message when a negative input is provided. The bug is that the error message does not provide enough context for the user to understand why the error occurred.  A solution is provided that improves the error message by providing more information about the input and the cause of the error. This improvement enhances the user experience and makes it easier to debug the code.
